# Hangprinter Documentation
This directory contains manuals written within the Hanpgrinter Project.
The files listed here are served at [hangprinter.org/doc](https://hangprinter.org/doc).

The intention is to document electronics, software, assembly, and calibration seperately and as independently as possible.
It should be possible to read them in any order and still have meaningful results.

On April 18, 2018, only the assembly manual is done. See v3/index.xml.
