    Top-down is how manuals usually are: Starts with hardware, ends with software, avoids failure.
    Top-down language is coherent and precise, like the Oxford dictionary.
    Person 1 might think top-down explanations are exquisite, clear, delightful.
    Person 2 might think they're stiff, boring, ignorable.

  <p>
    Bottom-up view gets lights flashing and motors moving ASAP.
    It's organized as a series of increasingly sophisticated failures.
    Person 1 might think it's inelegant and fragmented, but Person 2 might feel like "Yeah! The bottom-up view makes things happen!"
    <!--Bottom-up manual language is more like <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/">urban dictionary</a>.
      Just press print!
      Just press print!
    It is for Person 2, who wants to press print and is looking for a button. -->

    They both deserve a good manual.
    Being Person 1 in the morning, and Person 2 in the evening is perfectly normal.

    Then there's also Person 3, who wants to skim, but not really follow any manual, regardless of what's in there.
    Person 3 will typically not read the second sentence in a paragraph like this one.
    So since you're here, you're probably not person 3 right now.
    Person 3 also deserves some prepared material:
