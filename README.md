===========

This is the working branch of the Hangprinter repository.
Breaking changes may occur from time to time.
The Hangprinter repo does not yet have a stable branch.
This branch will become our (first!) stable branch when stock Marlin v2 is ready to be included as the default Hangprinter firmware.

This document and this repo are solely about technical aspects of Hangprinter version 3.
For more general information about the Hangprinter Project, refer to [hangprinter.org](https://hangprinter.org)

A Google Spreadsheet version for a Mechaduino-driven setup, up to date as of Apr 4 2018, is found here: [Google docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lOPZoF1P2OSdJcijZRVrwAEVFh3LLAnf6-s6k-hlbZU/edit?usp=sharing)

Assembly Instructions
---------------------
The documentation hosted in this repo is published at [hangprinter.org/doc/v3](https://hangprinter.org/doc/v3).

Using Nema23?
----------------
Then you need different sized motor brackets, extruder holders and motor gears.
To compile those do
```
make nema23
```
This compiles the files and puts them in the `openscad_stl_nema23/` directory.
It also creates the `layout_nema23.dxf` file.
To make a 2d-printable pdf of the layout, do
```
make layout_nema23_a4.pdf
```

Using letter sized paper?
-------------------------
You can wedge that into the make-calls, like
```
make layout_letter.pdf
```
The following works if you're using nema23:
```
make layout_nema23_letter.pdf
```

The pdf creation command has been tested on a Ubuntu 14.04 system
with Cairosvg v1.0.4, sed v4.2.2, and Ghostscript v9.10.
